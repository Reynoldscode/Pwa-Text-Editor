# Text Editor Web Application

This is a text editor web application built with modern web technologies.


## Getting Started

To run the application locally:
Type in the url: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/rey-note-taker
click on the open app to launch the app 


This command will start both the backend server and serve the client.

## Development Features


When you open my application in my editor then you should see a client server folder structure

When you run `npm run start` from the root directory then you find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
When you run the text editor application from my terminal

then you find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
When you run my webpack plugins

then you find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
When you use next-gen JavaScript in my application then you find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors

When you open the text editor then you find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage

When you enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window then you find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB

When you reopen the text editor after closing it then you find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
When you click on the Install button then you download my web application as an icon on my desktop

When you load my web application then you should have a registered service worker using workbox

When you register a service worker then you should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and
 static assets
When you deploy to Render then you should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
